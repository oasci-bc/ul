# Unsupervised Learning - Breadcrumbs

TODO:

## What is Breadcrumbs?

Education stands as a pivotal force in socioeconomic mobility.
Yet, generational barriers outside of an individual's influence hinder a person's access to educational opportunities.
Breadcrumbs represents [OASCI's](https://www.oasci.org/) initiative to fundamentally transform access to educational materials, embodying the spirit of discovery and the sharing of knowledge fragments that have traditionally been accessible only through the goodwill of others.
Breadcrumb websites are freely accessible resources, and we encourage contributions, improvements, and adaptations so long as they abide by the terms outlined in the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license.

## Deploying

We use [bump-my-version](https://github.com/callowayproject/bump-my-version) to release a new version.
This will create a git tag that is used by [poetry-dynamic-version](https://github.com/mtkennerly/poetry-dynamic-versioning) to generate version strings.

However, we are using [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) which means we need to manually specify new versions.
For example, to bump the version to November 8, 2024, you would run the following command after activating the relevant conda environment.

```bash
bump-my-version bump --new-version 2024.11.8
```

After releasing a new version, you need to push and include all tags.

```bash
git push --follow-tags
```
